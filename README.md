# BrowserVPN
A vpn that sits in your browser, accessible via a website

Setup:
1. Put the code onto the server of your choice (provided it supports python). Remplit is recommended as I have made a copy already on there (link goes here).

2. Edit the config file to allow your region to use the system. This is here as some countries ban VPNs. You can also change the default link as well as known links that do not work, or leave as default for an automatic list.

3. Turn on the server and enjoy!
